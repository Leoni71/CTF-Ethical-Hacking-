Well, here you are. In order to stop the opera, we found that it's possible to take the theater's electrical system down as long as you could help us get the password to enter the switching room. 

The only thing we know is that it's a 16-digit password in lower-case letters and the cipher text is "hmhmrmrm".

Good luck!
